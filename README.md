# shibaofwisdom

Final freestyle project for OPIM 244 (Spring 2021)


##Setup

Create and activate a new virtual environment from the command line (e.g. GitBash):

```sh
conda create -n shiba-env python=3.8
```

You only have to create the environment the first time you run the program. To activate the environment for the first time and any time after running the program, enter this from the command line:

```sh
conda activate shiba-env
```
